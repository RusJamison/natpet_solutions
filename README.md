This document serves as an introduction to a Django-based e-commerce platform specifically designed for selling medical equipment. The platform aims to provide a seamless shopping experience for healthcare professionals and institutions, offering a wide range of medical devices and supplies. With a focus on user-friendly navigation, secure transactions, and comprehensive product information, this e-commerce solution is tailored to meet the unique needs of the medical industry.

This platform is built using the Django web framework, leveraging its powerful features to create a robust online store dedicated to medical supplies. Our goal is to facilitate the procurement of essential medical equipment for hospitals, clinics, and individual practitioners, ensuring they have access to high-quality products.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface** : Designed with the end-user in mind, our platform offers intuitive navigation and a clean layout, making it easy for customers to find and purchase the equipment they need.

- **Secure Payment Processing** : We prioritize the security of our users' data. The platform integrates with trusted payment gateways to ensure safe and reliable transactions.

- **Comprehensive Product Catalog** : Our extensive inventory includes a wide variety of medical equipment, complete with detailed descriptions, specifications, and images to assist customers in making informed decisions.

- **Order Management** : Users can easily track their orders, manage returns, and receive updates on their purchases through a streamlined order management system.

- **Responsive Design** : The platform is optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a consistent shopping experience across all devices.

The primary goal for this project is to create a fully functional and easy-to-use e-commerce store that allow users to browse a number of different products to add to their shopping bag, so that they can checkout securely using Stripe online payment processing system and complete a purchase.

**Stripe test card:**
  - test card number 4242 4242 4242 4242, 
  - a random three-digit CVC number, 
  - and any expiration date in the future.

Please note: The website is for educational purposes only and uses Stripe test mode to simulate payments.

A user should be able to register to the site and store their personal information, such as default delivery information and view their past order history. They should also be presented with the option to contact store admin and visit Natpet Solution's Facebook business page so that they can stay up to date with all the latest news.
